1. clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Ayshyama/forTutoring
```
2. check remote
```
git remote -v
```
3. if remote is not Ayshyama/forTutoring, then add remote
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Ayshyama/forTutoring.git
```

4. If you want to have the same repository inside your Git account, you can fork it.

- When you fork a project, you essentially create a copy of the original (upstream) repository under your own GitHub account. 
- This gives you full control over your forked repository, and you can push updates to it as you wish. 

### Here's how you can manage where to push your updates:

### Two Remote Repositories

- Origin: This is your forked repository. When you clone your fork to your local machine, 
- Git automatically names this remote "origin".

- Upstream: This is the original repository that you forked. 
- Generally, you would add this as a second remote named "upstream" to pull in changes from the original project.

### Pulling Updates from the Original Repository(Upstream)

1. Navigate to Local Repository: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory of your local Git repository.
2. Add Upstream Remote: If you haven't already added the original repository as an "upstream" remote, you can do so with:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ayshyama/forTutoring.git
```
or ssh
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:original_owner/original_repository.git
```
3. verify remote (you should see origin and upstream) 
```
git remote -v
```
4. Fetch and Merge Changes from Upstream (original repo)
- Fetch will only download the changes from the upstream repository, but not merge them with your local commits.
- Before pushing new changes, it's often good to fetch and merge changes from the "upstream" repository so that your fork stays up-to-date.
```
git fetch upstream
```
5. Checkout Branch: Make sure you are on the branch into which you want to merge the updates (commonly main).
```
git branch
```
```
git checkout main
```
6. Merge Changes: Merge the changes from the upstream repository's main branch into your local main branch.
```
git merge upstream/main
```
7. Push to Your Fork: Finally, push these merged changes to your own forked repository on GitHub.
- Push Changes to Your Fork: After resolving any conflicts and committing your changes, you can push to your fork.
```
git push origin main
```

### If you have set wrong remote origin or upstream follow these steps:
- to change remote origin
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
- to change remote upstream
```
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

















Steps to Add Upstream and Decide Where to Push
- 
Clone Your Fork: If you haven't already, clone your forked repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/forked_repository.git
Check Current Remotes: You can view the current remotes to see where the code will be pushed or pulled from.

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
This will typically show "origin" pointing to your forked repository.

Add Upstream Remote: Navigate to your local repository directory and add the original repository as an "upstream" remote.

bash
Copy code
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original_owner/original_repository.git
Decide Where to Push: Now you have two remotes: "origin" and "upstream".

Push to your fork: git push origin <branch_name>
You generally can't push to upstream unless you are an authorized contributor.
Fetch and Merge Changes from Upstream: Before pushing new changes, it's often good to fetch and merge changes from the "upstream" repository so that your fork stays up-to-date.

bash
Copy code
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
or in one command:

bash
Copy code
git pull upstream main
Push to Your Fork: After resolving any conflicts and committing your changes, you can push to your fork.

bash
Copy code
git push origin <branch_name>
By managing your remotes this way, you can decide whether to push your updates to your fork ("origin") or create a pull request to contribute changes back to the original project ("upstream"). Most often, you'll be pushing to your own fork and then creating a pull request to propose changes to the upstream project.
